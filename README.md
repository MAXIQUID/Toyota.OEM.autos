# Toyota.OEM.autos

A curated and structured repository of **Toyota vehicle data**, originally based on the `Cars-Toyota` collection.  
This repo leverages FiveM vehicle configurations as **surrogate digital twins** of real Toyota models — enabling structured OEM mapping, reverse engineering, and lifecycle simulation.

Most late-model make/models were already available in public **FiveM car packs**, which made cloning and adapting these repositories a convenient starting point for building structured digital representations.

Part of the broader `OEM.autos` ecosystem by **TWENTYTHIRTY**.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Repurpose FiveM vehicle data as **digital twins** for real Toyota models  
- Link and extract OEM part mappings, group indexes, and trim configurations  
- Enable simulation, teardown visualization, and virtual repair planning  
- Serve as a backend reference for structured automotive applications  

## 📁 Structure
- `vehicles/` — Digital twin configs per Toyota model (adapted from FiveM)  
- `foe_exports/` — Factory Original Equipment (FOE) flat JSON part data  
- `resources/` — Logos, trim metadata, and linked imagery  
- `meta/` — Model indexing, historical mapping, and versioning  

## 🔧 Use Cases
- Circular economy lifecycle modeling  
- Digital teardown mapping  
- OEM vs aftermarket comparison  
- Educational tools for virtual automotive training
